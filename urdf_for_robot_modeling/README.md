# URDF for Robot Modeling
## Robot Ignite Academy: URDF for Robot Modeling	
Understanding robot modeling using URDF.

## Course Overview	
As human beings, we learn from a very young age about our body’s structure: which bones and muscles are part of it, how they are connected between them, how we can move each articulation, etc.

For a robot, though, how can we know all this information? Well, this is exactly what URDF files are going to tell us. URDF files define the structure of a robot, the connection between all the different parts, etc.

In this course, you will understand how URDF files work, and how to create them for any robot.	

## What You Will Learn	
How to build a visual robot model with URDF
How to add physical properties to a URDF Model (Collision, Frictions…)
How to use XACRO to clean up URDF files.
How to use URDF in Gazebo-ROS ecosystem.
