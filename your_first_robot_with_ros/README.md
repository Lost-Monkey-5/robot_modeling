# Your First Robot With ROS
##Robot Ignite Academy: Your First Robot with ROS	
Creating your first ROS based Robot from Scratch.	

##Course Overview	
Have you ever dreamed of creating a robot, a robot that truly belongs to you.	

Within this course, you are going to make your dream come true. You will go through the whole process of mounting the robot, creating a simulation for the robot so that you can test your ROS programs there, building all the controllers for the robot, and finally, getting it to autonomously navigate using ROS tools.	

##What You Will Learn	
From idea to real robot	
How to mount a real robot	
How to create a simulation for the robot	
How to control your robot with ROS	
Advanced Utilities: Autonomous Navigation, Deep Learning â€¦
